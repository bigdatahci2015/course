                        <h1 id="excused-absences">Excused Absences</h1>
<p>There are only four legitimate excuses for missing classes (adapted from other courses). Since participation (i.e., attending the hackathon) constitutes a significant portion of your grade, you are required to attend every course to earn your grade. If you do need to miss a class and your reason is legitimate, you can later participate in a <em>makeup hackathon</em> arranged by the teaching staff. The details and date of this session will be determined depending on the number of people who need it. It is likely to be toward the end of the semester.</p>
<p>The four legitimate reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illness:</strong> In the event you become ill and cannot attend class, please email me and your team as soon as possible to notify me/them about your illness. Students who are ill with flu-like symptoms should NOT come to class or have close contact with other students (e.g., study groups). They should NOT return to class until 24 hours after their fever has abated. Honor Code &#x2013; abuse of a more lenient absence policy and attendance in class while contagious are not acceptable. In the event a loved one becomes ill and you cannot attend class because you must care for your loved one, please email me.</li>
<li><strong>Travel:</strong> In the event that you have to travel during the semester and miss class, I must be notified at least two weeks in advance (business travel will be given some leeway with the time frame) and you must later participate in a makeup session in order not to lose your participation grade. You are responsible for gathering materials, assignments, etc. that you missed in your absence &#x2013;this means talking to your classmates and reading materials posted online. DO NOT email me asking what you missed &#x2013; it is your responsibility to find out.</li>
<li><strong>Death:</strong> In the event that a loved one dies and you must miss class or your progress slows, you must present documentation of the death (e.g., funeral card or funeral program).</li>
<li><strong>Law Incidents:</strong> In the event you or a loved one has an incident with the law, documentation will be needed to show that the incident happened during class and that is why you could not attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of reasons not considered legitimate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I overslept.</li>
<li>I needed to go to this party.</li>
<li>I did not have a chance to do the challenge and I don&#x2019;t think I am ready to participate in the hackathon.</li>
<li>I am too tired.</li>
<li>I need to study for an exam for another course.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="accommodations-for-disability">Accommodations for Disability</h1>
<p>If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu.</p>
<p>If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines under Quick Links at Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your professor.</p>
<h1 id="religious-observances">Religious Observances</h1>
<p>Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. please send me e-mail or visit me in office hours to notify me of such a situation at least two weeks in advance of the event. See full details at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html</a>.</p>
<h1 id="classroom-behavior">Classroom Behavior</h1>
<p>Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran&apos;s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student&apos;s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html</a> and at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code</a>.</p>
<h1 id="discrimination-and-harassment">Discrimination and Harassment</h1>
<p>The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities. (Regent Law, Article 10, amended 11/8/2001). CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, &quot;Protected Classes&quot; refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, andthe campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/odh" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/odh</a></p>
<h1 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council</p>
<p>(honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html</a>and at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/</a></p>
