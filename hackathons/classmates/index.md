# Week 1 - Classmates

Date: August 31, 2015

## Review: Submissions

Did you submit your team/individual learning challenges correctly? We look at TWO things: your __commit history__ and __published book__.

### 1. Commit History

The commit history of your book shows one commit by Friday night and the other one by Sunday night, for example

* [fadhilfath's commit history](https://github.com/fadhilfath/book/commits/master)
    ![commits](commits1.png)
* [boanding's commit history](https://github.com/boanding/book/commits/master)
    ![commits](commits2.png)


If you finished the individual portion together with the team portion by the Friday night deadline, it is okay
to have both in a single commit, for example

* [calebhsu's commit history](https://github.com/calebhsu/book/commits/master)
    ![commits](commits3.png)

### 2. Published Book

Your book has been published with the most update-to-date contents, for example

* [kjblakemore's book](http://kjblakemore.github.io/book/learning/week1/)


## Setup
